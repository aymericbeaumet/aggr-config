The setting `amp.mcpPermissions` defines rules that block or allow MCP servers.

MCP permissions are evaluated using a rule-based system with the same pattern matching syntax that is used for [tool permissions](https://ampcode.com/manual#permissions). The first matching rule determines the action. If no rules match, the MCP server is allowed by default.

The following configuration would block all MCP servers except locally-executed servers from the `@modelcontextprotocol` npm organization and remote servers from `trusted-service.com`:

```json
{
	"amp.mcpPermissions": [
		{
			"matches": { "command": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-*" },
			"action": "allow"
		},
		{
			"matches": { "url": "https://trusted-service.com/mcp/*" },
			"action": "allow"
		},
		{
			"matches": { "url": "*" },
			"action": "reject"
		}
		{
			"matches": { "command": "*" },
			"action": "reject"
		}
	]
}
```
