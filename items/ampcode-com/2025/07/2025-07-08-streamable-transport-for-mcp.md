Amp now uses [streamable HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http) for MCP servers by default with a fallback to Server-Sent Events.

That allows you to connect to your own MCP servers hosted on [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/streamable-http-mcp-servers-python/) or use other remote servers such as `https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp`.
