These @-mentioned files with globs will only be included if Amp has read a file matching any of the globs (in the example above, any TypeScript file).

Your [`AGENTS.md` files](https://ampcode.com/manual#AGENTS.md) can now include other context files dynamically, with glob mentions and filters, so you can give more granular guidance to the agent.

For example, to apply language-specific coding rules:

1. Put `See @docs/*.md` anywhere in your `AGENTS.md` file.

2. Create a file `docs/typescript-conventions.md` with:

   ```markdown
   ---
   globs:
     - '**/*.ts'
   ---

   Follow these TypeScript conventions:

   - Never use the `any` type
   - ...
   ```

3. Repeat for other languages.

There's nothing special about `@docs/*.md`; you could instead mention `@.agent/rules/*.md` or `@.cursor/rules/*.mdc` or anywhere else you want these rules to live.

These @-mentioned files with `globs` will only be included if Amp has read a file matching any of the globs (in the example above, any TypeScript file). Use `/agent-files` (CLI) or hover over `X% of 968k` (editor extension) to see the guidance files in use.
