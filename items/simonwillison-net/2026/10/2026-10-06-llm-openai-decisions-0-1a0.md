**Release:** [llm-openai-decisions 0.1a0](https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-decisions/releases/tag/0.1a0)

OpenAI released their new Jev-style [Decisions API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/decisions), as previously announced at last week's DevDay.

Since I already have an [llm-typesafe](https://github.com/simonw/llm-typesafe) plugin for talking to Jev, I had GPT-6 Astra read the new OpenAI API documentation and build an `llm-openai-decisions` plugin inspired by `llm-typesafe`.

Unlike Jev, the new `gpt-6-luna` decision model supports image input in addition to text. Both models charge for input it and not for output: OpenAI's is 10 cents per million input tokens, Jev's is 4.2 cents per million.

Otherwise the API shape is *very* similar to Jev, at least conceptually. Jev [supports three question types](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Sep/21/jev/#three-types) for yes/no, choices, or scores. OpenAI Decisions supports the same three types.

Install the plugin like this:

```
llm install llm-openai-decisions
```

Here's an example query against an image attachment:

```shell
llm -m openai-decisions/gpt-6-luna \
  -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg \
  -s 'Does this image contain any mammals?'
```

And example output:

```json
{"type": "predicate", "name": "evaluation", "probability": 0.0}
```

Consult [the README](https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-decisions/blob/main/README.md) for full details of how to run the other types of questions.
