**[Deno is joining Cloudflare](https://deno.com/blog/cloudflare)**

The Deno team released the first version of [celld](https://github.com/denoland/celld) back in August - their open source implementation of the Durable Objects pattern from Cloudflare Workers.

Today, Cloudflare are acquiring Deno outright, with the goal of building on `celld` to "make workerd self-hosting a first-class supported way to build and run apps using the Workers programming model" (see [the Cloudflare blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/deno-joins-cloudflare/).)

The bad news is that Deno itself will not be maintained by Cloudflare beyond the next year:

> We will support the [Deno runtime](https://github.com/denoland/deno) for another year with monthly releases containing bug fixes and security updates. After that year we will end our development of the Deno runtime. Deno will remain open source, and we welcome others who want to continue its development.

Deno (and Node.js) creator Ryan Dahl explained that decision in [a comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=50019911#50023277) on Hacker News:

> It's a joint decision and I agree with it. I'm most invested in its success and have put the most work into it - and I no longer think it's where I can do the most important work.

My favorite feature of Deno has long been the permissions system, where you can run a Deno script and specify exactly which files and folders it can read and write to, and which network hosts it can access.

Node.js [has a similar permissions model](https://nodejs.org/api/permissions.html) these days, added [in Node v20.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.0.0) in April 2023 and declared stable [in Node v22.13.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.13.0) in January 2025.
