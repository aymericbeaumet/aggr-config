[Preview the next release](https://cow-wm.codeberg.page/cow/changelog/development/)

The aims of CoW are to represent the 90s look-and-feel of FVWM and MWM, while also allowing for more modern styles as well. CoW can be configured directly through commands and the same commands can be used in its configuration file, making CoW scriptable through external applications.

High-level features include:

- IPC scripting.
- Server-side decorations can be customisable.
- Placement of windows through different commands.
- Native menu support.
- Rules can control scripting.
- Internal DSL (Domain Specific Language) allows for filtering.

... plus a lot more!

CoW is developed in C, hosted on Codeberg. The community is small but friendly, and we can be found on IRC (irc.libera.chat, in #cow-wayland)
